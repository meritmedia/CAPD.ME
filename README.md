# CAPD.ME
A PDA for people on CAPD
Hi, my name is Charlie and I'm developing CAPD ME a website for CKD patients who dialyze without a machine, or cycler. Our kidneys usually filter and remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood. Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is a way of replacing your kidney function, if your kidneys have failed, by using the membrane covering your internal organs (the peritoneum). In performing this treatment, patients and those who assist them have a myriad of tasks: keeping a daily schedule, logging treatments, keeping a calendar of deliveries, inventory, and reporting, as well as providing links to entertainment while engaged in the dialysis. I have End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and am developing CAPD ME in between my own treatments. I want to avoid cluttering the site with ads. Your donation will go to cover server and other development costs. If you find the site useful please give what you can. Thank you.
