# CAPD.ME
A PDA for people on CAPD
Hi, my name is Charlie and I'm developing CAPD ME a website for CKD patients who dialyze without a machine, or cycler. 

I have End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and am developing CAPD ME in between my own treatments.

I inially wanted to do this as a one-page app and am looking to redo it in that manner, when I get the time. The code is a mess. I break all kinds of rules of good development because I was - and still am - in a rush. It's difficult programming when you know you have to start and stop every hour and a half. Continuity becomes a major issue.

Our kidneys usually filter and remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood. Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is a way of replacing your kidney function, if your kidneys have failed, by using the membrane covering your internal organs (the peritoneum). In performing this treatment, patients and those who assist them have a myriad of tasks: keeping a daily schedule, logging treatments, keeping a calendar of deliveries, inventory, and reporting, as well as providing links to entertainment while engaged in the dialysis.
